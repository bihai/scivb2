- Highlightactive line goes blank on lose focus
- is there a way to set a line backcolor like for breakpoint (or bold or red)
- Locked should be a property not a method 
- sometimes delete marker does not work? after running a script in duk4vb

is sci.ReplaceBuggy? test
sample input: class.method(x). previous word here should return 'method' not blank but I would have to count [] and () and support multiple embeddings
