This control has been modified from its original. This build has
been termed as SCIVB_LITE and it further simplifies the interface
and use. The orginal project source is included as original.zip

This build is generally compatiable with code written for the 
original except for some rarely used features which have been
removed, or moved into the misc class. In one or two instances
a method name may have changed as well to better describe what it
does.

Binary compatiability has not yet been set for this control. Once I 
get a bit further along I will set it.
