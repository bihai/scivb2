| Purpose:							|
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Provide an easy to use interface for VB devlopers wishing to  |
| make use of the Scintilla Source Code component.		|
+---------------------------------------------------------------+

For those of you not already aware Scintilla is a source editing
component written in C++ and wrapped in the form of a DLL.  It
is available freely from http://www.scintilla.org.  It is updated
regularly with new features, bug fixes and enhancements.  

This control has been modified from its original. This build has
been termed as SCIVB_LITE and it further simplifies the interface
and use. The main project source is also included as original.zip

Modification to this build by dzzie@yahoo.com


Below are some credit's I would like to list to people who's source

project.
